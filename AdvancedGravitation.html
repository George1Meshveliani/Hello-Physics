                    <p>This linear approximation is highly accurate for altitudes up to about 100 km.</p>

                    <h3>Proof: Variation of $g$ with Depth</h3>
                    <p>Assuming the Earth has a uniform density $\rho$, the gravitational force on a mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center ($r < R_E$) is due only to the mass enclosed within the sphere of radius $r$, according to the Shell Theorem. The mass enclosed is $M_{enc} = \rho \cdot V_r = \frac{M_E}{(4/3)\pi R_E^3} \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = M_E \frac{r^3}{R_E^3}$.</p>
                    <p>The gravitational force is $F_g(r) = G \frac{M_{enc}m}{r^2} = G \frac{(M_E r^3/R_E^3)m}{r^2} = \left(\frac{GM_E m}{R_E^3}\right) r$.</p>
                    <p>Since $F_g = mg(r)$, the gravitational acceleration inside the Earth is:</p>

                    <p>From Newton's second law for circular motion: $G \frac{Mm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$.</p>

                <div class="proof">
                    <h3>Proof of Kepler's First Law (Law of Orbits)</h3>
                    <p>The derivation of elliptical orbits from Newton's laws is a classic problem in mechanics. It involves solving the vector equation of motion $\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$ for a central force. Using polar coordinates, the equation of motion for the reduced mass $\mu$ is:</p>
                    $$ \mu(\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2) = -G\frac{M\mu}{r^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \mu(r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}) = 0 $$
                    <p>The second equation implies conservation of angular momentum, $L = \mu r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{const}$. This can be used to eliminate $\dot{\theta}$ from the radial equation. The substitution $u=1/r$ transforms the radial equation into a simpler form (Binet's equation):</p>
                    <div class="formula">$$ \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM\mu^2}{L^2} $$</div>
                    <p>This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with a constant term. Its solution is $u(\theta) = A\cos(\theta - \theta_0) + \frac{GM\mu^2}{L^2}$. Converting back to $r=1/u$ gives the equation for a conic section:</p>
                    <div class="formula">$$ r(\theta) = \frac{L^2/(GM\mu^2)}{1 + \epsilon \cos(\theta-\theta_0)} $$</div>
                    <p>where $\epsilon = AL^2/(GM\mu^2)$ is the eccentricity. For a bound orbit, $0 \le \epsilon < 1$, which defines an ellipse. This proves planets move in elliptical orbits.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="proof">
                    <h3>Proof of Kepler's Second Law (Law of Areas)</h3>
                    <p>This law is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. Since gravity is a central force, the torque $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}_g$ is zero, which implies the angular momentum $\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}$ is constant.</p>
                    <p>The infinitesimal area $dA$ swept by the position vector $\vec{r}$ in time $dt$ is $dA = \frac{1}{2} |\vec{r} \times d\vec{r}| = \frac{1}{2} |\vec{r} \times \vec{v}dt|$. The rate of change of area is:</p>
                    <div class="formula">$$ \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} |\vec{r} \times \vec{v}| = \frac{|\vec{L}|}{2m} = \text{constant} $$</div>
                </div>
                <div class="proof">
                    <h3>Proof of Kepler's Third Law (Law of Periods)</h3>
                    <p>The total area of an ellipse is $A = \pi ab$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis and $b$ is the semi-minor axis. The orbital period is $T = A / (dA/dt)$.</p>
                    <p>Using $dA/dt = L/2m$, we get $T = \frac{2m(\pi ab)}{L}$. For an ellipse, $b=a\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}$ and the angular momentum can be shown to be $L = \sqrt{GMm^2 a(1-\epsilon^2)}$.</p>
                    <p>Substituting these into the period equation:</p>
                    $$ T = \frac{2m\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}}{\sqrt{GMm^2 a(1-\epsilon^2)}} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}} $$
                    <p>Squaring both sides gives the celebrated result:</p>
                    <div class="formula">$$ T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3 \quad \implies \quad T^2 \propto a^3 $$</div>

                    <h3>Proof of Shell Theorem via Direct Integration</h3>
                    
                    <p>We prove that the gravitational force outside a uniform spherical shell of mass $M$ is the same as if all its mass were at its center by calculating the potential.</p>
                    <p>Consider a ring on the shell at an angle $\theta$. The mass of the ring is $dM = \frac{M}{2}\sin\theta d\theta$. Every point on this ring is at a distance $s$ from the external point mass $m$. From the Law of Cosines, $s^2 = r^2 + R^2 - 2rR\cos\theta$.</p>
                    <p>The potential from the ring is $dU = -G \frac{m \, dM}{s}$. By changing variables from $\theta$ to $s$ (where $2s\,ds = 2rR\sin\theta d\theta$) and integrating over the entire shell (from $s=r-R$ to $s=r+R$ for a point outside), we find:</p>
                    $$ U = \int dU = \int_{r-R}^{r+R} -G\frac{m(M/2rR)s\,ds}{s} = -\frac{GMm}{2rR} \int_{r-R}^{r+R} ds $$
                    <div class="formula">$$ U_{out} = - \frac{GMm}{r} $$</div>
                    <p>For a point inside the shell, the limits of integration are $R-r$ to $R+r$, which yields a constant potential: $U_{in} = -GMm/R$. Since force is the negative gradient of potential, $F = -dU/dr$, the force inside the shell is zero.</p>

                <div class="proof">
                    <h3>Proof of Shell Theorem via Gauss's Law for Gravity</h3>
                    
                    <p>A more elegant proof uses Gauss's Law for Gravity, which is analogous to Gauss's Law in electrostatics. It states that the flux of the gravitational field through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed mass.</p>
                    <div class="formula">$$ \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{enc} $$</div>
                    <p><b>Outside the shell ($r > R$):</b> We choose a spherical Gaussian surface of radius $r$. By symmetry, $\vec{g}$ must be radial and have constant magnitude on the surface. So, $\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = g(4\pi r^2)$. The enclosed mass is the entire shell, $M_{enc}=M$.</p>
                    $$ g(4\pi r^2) = -4\pi GM \implies g = -G\frac{M}{r^2} $$
                    <p><b>Inside the shell ($r < R$):</b> We choose a spherical Gaussian surface of radius $r < R$. The enclosed mass is zero, $M_{enc}=0$.</p>
                    $$ g(4\pi r^2) = -4\pi G (0) \implies g=0 $$

                <p>An object on the surface of the rotating Earth is in a non-inertial reference frame. This causes its apparent weight (the reading on a scale) to differ from its true gravitational weight.</p>
                <p>The net force on an object at latitude $\lambda$ provides the centripetal force required for its circular path of radius $r_c = R_E \cos\lambda$ around the Earth's axis.</p>

                <p>The apparent weight is the normal force, $\vec{W}_{app} = \vec{F}_N = m\vec{g}_{true} - m\vec{a}_c$. The centripetal acceleration, $a_c = \omega^2 (R_E \cos\lambda)$, is directed perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This subtractive term is largest at the equator ($\lambda=0$) and zero at the poles ($\lambda=90^\circ$). The vector subtraction also means the apparent weight is not pointed directly towards the Earth's center (except at the equator and poles).</p>

                    <p>In a system with two large bodies (e.g., Sun and Earth) orbiting their common center of mass, there exist five points of stability known as Lagrange points. The L1 point lies on the line connecting the two bodies. A satellite placed at L1 will orbit the Sun with the same angular velocity as the Earth. Consider the Sun (mass $M_S$) and Earth (mass $M_E$) separated by distance $R$. In the rotating reference frame, find the distance $r$ from the Earth to the L1 point by balancing gravitational and centrifugal forces.
